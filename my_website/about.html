    <h1>Biography:</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Justin Nguyen and I am currently a Junior enrolling La Quinta High School. Junior year has been tough so far but I plan on ending this year strong. My goal for this year is to achieve a 4.4 GPA. While that may seem tough, I truly believe that I can accomplish this task. The reason why I want to end my Junior year with such a spectacular GPA is so that I can get accepted into my dream colleges. The two schools that I am dying to attend is UCI and UCSD. I plan to major in biology because my dream job is to join the medical field where I can contribute my efforts into helping the helpless and making my community a better and healthier society. Aside from education, there are many hobbies that sparks my interests. This includes playing tennis, traveling, and swimming. Volleyball and photography are two skills that I haven't learned yet, but I do plan on tackeling them at one point or another. My favorite subjects in school will have to be math and science because I feel very comfortable in getting a good grade in those classes. I hope you were able to get a feel of who I am after reading this paragraph! </p>
