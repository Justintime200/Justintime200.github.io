    <p>Ninja Dash is a game created by Justin Nguyen and James Pham. The purpose of Ninja Dash is to dodge the falling shuriken. If you are hit, then it is game over! One important script that my partner and I used during our game development was figuring out how to clone our shirukens. Basically, our script states that if the time reaches 20 seconds then the shiruken will create a clone of iteself and then waiting 2.5 seconds. Another important script that we used was the help menu. To activate this sequence, we first had to click the "question mark" icon and by clicking it it will broadcast the help screen. The toughest obstacle for us when creating this game was figuring out why our right wall was making our sprite turn upside down. While we are still unable to resolve that issue, we have decided to incorporate that strategic technique as it would enhance our gameplay and help our players use it to their advantage.</p>

    <p>A Tragic Tragedy is a story in which you, the player, will play as a character by the name of Finn. Your goal is to overcome a series of tough choices in order to go on a date with a girl named Rose. Will you be able to defy the odds and secure yourself a date with one of the most popular girl in school or will you fall into the pit of tragedy? The process to create this story wasn't difficult. We first started by brain storming ideas to create our story. After that we used a website named Gliffy to create a flow map that served as the foundation for our story. However, to succefully complete a story such as this, one would have to know how to utilize coding in Cloud9. While doing this project, my partner and I did not have any problems while working on our project. Throughout the months in this class, creating this story was definitely a unique experience compared to the other projects that I had to do such as creation of a website or game. The process is completely different but they all utilize the same skill. Even though my story was pretty amazing, there were definitely other stories out there that shined brighter than mine. One such story was The Life of Phuc written by Minh Khoi and Anjonny. The story had numerous ending, each one being completely different, unique, and enjoyable. Overall, this project was a very pleasing experience that allowed not only me, but also my peers to pour out their creativity to produce a special story.  </p>
