    <p>Ninja Dash is a game created by Justin Nguyen and James Pham. The purpose of Ninja Dash is to dodge the falling shuriken. If you are hit, then it is game over! One important script that my partner and I used during our game development was figuring out how to clone our shirukens. Basically, our script states that if the time reaches 20 seconds then the shiruken will create a clone of iteself and then waiting 2.5 seconds. Another important script that we used was the help menu. To activate this sequence, we first had to click the "question mark" icon and by clicking it it will broadcast the help screen. The toughest obstacle for us when creating this game was figuring out why our right wall was making our sprite turn upside down. While we are still unable to resolve that issue, we have decided to incorporate that strategic technique as it would enhance our gameplay and help our players use it to their advantage.</p>
